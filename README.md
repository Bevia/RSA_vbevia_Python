# Explanation:

    gcd Function: This function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
    mod_inverse Function: This function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
    main Function:
        Initializes prime numbers p and q.
        Calculates n as the product of p and q.
        Calculates phi as (p-1) * (q-1).
        Finds an integer e such that gcd(e, phi) == 1.
        Calculates d, the modular multiplicative inverse of e modulo phi.
        Encrypts a message msg using the public key (e, n).
        Decrypts the message using the private key (d, n).

## Theory by Vincent Bevia

Generating Public Key

1. Select two prime no's. Suppose P = 53 and Q = 59.
Now First part of the Public key  : n = P*Q = 3127.

2. We also need a small exponent say e :
   But e Must be

    -An integer.

    -Not be a factor of n.

    -1 < e < Φ(n) [Φ(n) is discussed below],
     Let us now consider it to be equal to 3.

The public key has been made of n and e

Generating Private Key

1. We need to calculate Φ(n) :
   Such that Φ(n) = (P-1)(Q-1)
      so,  Φ(n) = 3016

2. Now calculate Private Key, d :
   d = (k*Φ(n) + 1) / e for some integer k

3. For k = 2, value of d is 2011.

The private key has been made of d
    Consider two prime numbers p and q.
    Compute n = p*q
    Compute ϕ(n) = (p – 1) * (q – 1)
    Choose e such gcd(e , ϕ(n) ) = 1
    Calculate d such e*d mod ϕ(n) = 1
    Public Key {e,n} Private Key {d,n}
    Cipher text C = Pe mod n where P = plaintext
    For Decryption D = Dd mod n where D will refund the plaintext.
